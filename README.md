# 🧠 Customer Financial Behavior Classification

This project aims to classify customers based on their financial behavior patterns using machine learning techniques. It helps understand and segment customers for better financial product targeting and strategy.

## 📌 Project Overview

We use real-world financial behavior indicators — such as **Savings Rate**, **Investment Rate**, **Debt Ratio**, and **Spending Volatility** — to classify customers into distinct behavioral and financial goal categories like:

- **Saver**
- **Investor**
- **Spender**

## 📈 Example Use Case

> A bank wants to improve its customer segmentation strategy by analyzing financial behaviors.  
> Using this model, the bank can classify customers into "Savers", "Investors", or "Consumers" and offer personalized financial products — such as savings plans, investment portfolios, or debt management services — tailored to each segment's habits and goals.
