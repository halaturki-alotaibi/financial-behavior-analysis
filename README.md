# 🧠 Customer Financial Behavior Classification

This project aims to classify customers based on their financial behavior and financial goals using machine learning techniques. It supports financial institutions in understanding customer profiles to deliver more personalized and strategic financial services.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

We use real-world financial behavior indicators — such as **Monthly Income**, **Savings Rate**, **Investment Preferences**, **Debt Ratio**, and **Spending Habits** — to classify customers into meaningful financial **segments based on their goals**, including:

- **Saver** – Focused on long-term financial security and saving money.
- **Investor** – Interested in growing wealth through investments.
- **Spender** – Prioritizes current consumption over long-term saving or investing.

This segmentation enables better customer targeting and improved service personalization.

## 📈 Example Use Case

> A financial institution wants to improve its customer outreach and product alignment by analyzing financial behavior.  
> Using this model, the bank can classify each customer as a **Saver**, **Investor**, or **Spender**, then tailor financial services such as savings plans, retirement accounts, investment portfolios, or budgeting tools accordingly.
